TODO:
 While its better than before, there still work to do
- Global
	* Get rid of globals and start using references.
	* Merge all convertion functions at one tools.c library.
	* Normalize coding style.
- fumenbot.c
	* Loop and semaphores, standarize way libraries are invoked.
- time.c
	* Alarm related functions better but still nasty.
	*
- i2c.c
	* Conditions at ISR just handle Master and not in its best way.
	* ds1307 handler is just working, needs to be improved it.

WISHLIST:
	* Write eeprom library to store configuration there.
	* Add more handlers for sensors.
	* Add more handlers for TWI.
	* Rewrite serial library and add rs485 mode.

HISTORY:
- v0.71
Improved firmware
- Got rid of third party code but still using avr gcc libs.
- New time keeper using counter1 and fastest algoritm for alarms.
- New TWI interface using interrupts, including a wrap for ds1307.
- New ADC interface using interrupts. including a wrap for lm35.
- New DIO interface including PWM.

- v0.7
First implementation with Arduino, an ugly firmware written in C using third party code.

- v0.6
This implementation uses an old PC and its parallel port.
Written on Perl, it has a web interface and uses motion to control a webcam.
